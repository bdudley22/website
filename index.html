    <p>This is my first ruby project, a pokemon data engine built with ruby and uses ruby2d and httparty gems. Features an interactable GUI, and uses a basic API setup to display information about a user entered pokemon.</p>
    <p>Due to Ocra being very outdated I had a hard time getting this into an executable anybody can run. If it doesn't run on your machine you will need to install ruby to run it.</p>
